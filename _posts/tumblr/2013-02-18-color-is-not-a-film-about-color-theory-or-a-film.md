COLOR is not a film about color theory, or a film about the science of color, or even a film about the use of color in design. COLOR presents color as modern mythology in the context of Sachs’ art. For Sachs, it seems, each color has taken on, or been forced into, an identity - Hermes Orange, Tiffany Blue, etc - that epitomizes that hue. This maybe a statement on how branding and consumerism have undermined, or taken over culture. But, if looked at more neutrally, It may just be an exploration of a common experience of color. The colors we see represented consistently, as in marketing, come to mean those colors.

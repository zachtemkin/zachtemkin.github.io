COLOR is not a film about color theory, or a film about the science of color, or even a film about the use of color in design.<!--break--> COLOR presents color as modern mythology in the context of Sachs’ art. For Sachs, it seems, each color has taken on, or been forced into, an identity - Hermes Orange, Tiffany Blue, etc - that epitomizes that hue. This maybe a statement on how branding and consumerism have undermined, or taken over culture. But, if looked at more neutrally, It may just be an exploration of a common experience of color. The colors we see represented consistently, as in marketing, come to mean those colors.

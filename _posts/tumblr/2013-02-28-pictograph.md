A quick weekend project I recently re-visited, Pictograph is a meditative sort of toy that explores shape.<!--break--> I created it mainly because I wanted something visually interesting – but not to intellectually demanding – to mess with on my phone or computer. Pictograph works great on most smart phone browsers and can be used as a web app on iOS devices by adding a bookmark to the home screen. 
I have been thinking about implementing a feature where a user can add a name to a shape they create and then view other shapes named by people, sorted by name and by shape. However I’m worried that this might detract from the simplicity of my original intention for the project.

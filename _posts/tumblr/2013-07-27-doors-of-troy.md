Doors of Troy“Doors of Troy” is an illustration series in which I will explore the beautiful and, in my opinion, under-appreciated turn of the century architecture in Troy NY. I photographed the first four doors in the series while I was walking downtown; I felt that I could better capture their character and the emotional impact they had on me by abstracting them. By removing perspective and conveying light and depth using only solid colors, as opposed to gradients, I hope to strip away the usual context that surrounds these doors, as utilitarian objects, and present them in a more expressive way, as entities that possess emotional resonance. I hope to convey my experience of seeing them.

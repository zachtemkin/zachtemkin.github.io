Bret Victor makes a compelling argument for the misguidedness of the current paradigm for the future of interaction design.<!--break--> It is true that most predictions of future interfaces involve the same interactions that exist today, people poking and swiping surfaces with a finger or two. Although it’s true these predictions aren’t particularly innovative or forward thinking it is difficult to imagine the devices we use so much every day would be drastically different. We are maybe too close to them. Victor’s example of how tools need to be designed to fit the person and the problem ( the hammer example ) is interesting although maybe harder to apply to devices like smartphones which do so many different things. To design interfaces, for each application, that each function drastically differently is difficult to do when all of the applications are on the same device. It seems though that the only way to find a solution would be to distance oneself from the current paradigm enough to get a new perspective.

## Finding the place

Use this handy link and google will tell you what to do. Some helpful hints below:

[530 E 20TH ST / APT MH &rarr;](https://goo.gl/maps/mQdSpU4r16T2)


Once you're at 20th st and 1st ave, continue walking east 20th street, past Lenz's deli and Mount Saini Doctors. You'll come to a door to the right of a gym, this is it! Go in and use your card to get in the second door. Go up the small set of stairs, past the mailboxes, to the elevators. 

You are on the _T_ level. You can take the elevators to _M_ or use the stairs, just past the elevators. My apartment is just next to the stairs. If you take the elevators, turn right after getting off.

### You're in... now what?

You made it! If you don't mind taking your shoes off, that would be great. If you prefer to keep them on thats cool too, I get it. Head on in. You'll find the kitchen on your left.

Note: the lights should go on and off on their own but if you want to adjust to your liking i've left an iPad mini on the dining table with the Phillips hue app up and loaded. Go nuts!

## Feeding the Beast

You'll find all Ms.Mitten's food in the bottom drawer at the back of the kitchen, under the window. Dry food is in a tupperware container and wet food is in pouches in the drawer. 

Lola gets one _pack of wet food per day_. For dry food just _top off_ her other dish. If it's completely empty you don't need to fill it all the way (I think she's getting kina fat :3)

If you run out of dry food there is a huge bag on the bottom shelf of the tall cuppord on the right of the kitchen enterance. 

Inside the food drawer, you'll also see a few puches of treats. There's a pouch of _Pet Naturals Calming Treats_. Leave one of these in her dry food bowl. You can give her a few of the normal treats too, she'll thank ya.

## Scooping the Poops &#57434;

Lola and I are both VERY appreciative of this. You'll find the litter box in my bedroom, at the back of the apartment.

First you'll need the trash can. I left it right by the litter box. There's a box of more bags at the bottom of the can.

Now, to open the litter box, first remove the scooper. Then, press in on the latch at the front of the box and the lid swings open. You can actually remove it for now to make it easier.

Ok... I think you know what's next... we're all cat people. On your way out you can throw the poops down the trash chute in the hallway. Youll find it on the wall opposite the elevators behind a door (the only door without a lock).

Phew... now for the fun part!

## Loving the fur ball

Lola is usually super friendly. She loves belly rubs and getting scratched under her chin and basically any other form of attention...

Shes goes nuts for her mouse-on-a-stick toy and has a few little stuffed mice around somewhere. Please play with her for as much or as little time as you want!

## If you wanna hang out

### Interwebs... We got 'em!
Wifi: _"Batcave"_

PW: _"by permit only"_

### Television
You should be able to just turn on the TV with the Samsung remote but, if not, using the long, Yamaha remote, make sure the reciever is turned on and set to "HDMI 2". Then you can use the Samsung remote to control thr TV normally. Netflix and Hulu are all set up.

I think I'm going to leave the couch covered with a blanket just in case she gets a little scratchy but if you wanna chill you can move it ¯\_(ツ)_/¯ 

### That's it!

If you have any problems I'll be able to send and recieve texts in the morning and evening. Send pics!

# Thank you so much :3

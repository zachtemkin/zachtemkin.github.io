				<p class="about-first">US FIRST (For Inspiration and Recognition in Science and Technology) is a non-profit organization that strives to inspire young people to be leaders in science and technology. This organization lets students be involved with activities that teach them about skills in engineering, business, and technology as well as life skills such as leadership, teamwork, communication and self-confidence.</p> 
				<p class="about-first">Founded in 1989 in Manchester, New Hampshire, this non-profit organization has inspired many students to pursue a college and graduate education in the fields of engineering or science. This program also inspires students to have good values. The term Gracious Professionalism is part of the spirit of FIRST encouraging quality work, strong competition, but also emphasizing the respect of others and the community despite the competition. This promotes helping society by acting with integrity and sensitivity. Coopertition is a concept saying how teams should still cooperate with teams even as they compete with them. Not only has FIRST made impact on the education of the students, they have also made them better team members.</p> 
				<p class="about-first">US FIRST has a variety of Robotics Programs for many age groups ranging from ages six through eighteen. These programs are Jr. FIRST Lego League, FIRST Lego League, FIRST Tech Challenge, and FIRST Robotics Challenge. These programs provide students of all ages with the oppurtunity to be hands-on with engineering and science and to be inspired to pursue careers in those fields.</p>
				<p class="about-first"><em>"To transform our culture by creating a world where science and technology are celebrated and where young people dream of becoming science and technology leaders."</em> <b>-Dean Kamen, Founder</b></p>

				<h3>The Steel Hawks</h3>
				<p class="abuot-team"> The Steel Hawks, FRC Team 2601 is an up-and-coming robotics team founded in 2008, located in Flushing, New York at Townsend Harris High School. Our team started as a small group of about ten high school juniors and seniors coached by Mr. Phillip Jones. Over the course of the next three seasons, the team grew in size to approximately 40 students from all high school grades aided by our two coahes: Mr. Jones and Ms. Oberlander, the Assistant Pricipal of Science: Ms. Brustein, as well as several mentors from Queens College and parent assistants.</p> 
				<p class="abuot-team"> Last year, we participated in the New York City Regional Competition coming in 11th place out of over 60 teams and competed in the quarter finals.</p>

			<div id="team-history">
				<h3>Team History</h3>
				<p class="history">Beginning in January of 2008, the Steel Hawks started as a small team of only seven students with no experience and very little guidance. The idea was brought up by Mr. Jones, who has been a coach for the team since the very beginning and the team was started when there were enough students who showed an interest. Although the number of those were interested were few, it was the beginning of a new community and a whole new level of science at Townsend Harris High School.</p>
				<p class="history">In the team's first two years, many of the skills necessary to create the robot, such as how to use tools and basic programming, were self taught by the students. Assistance was very limited to the two coahces, who also were new to FIRST, and Howard Rose, the machinist at Queens College. Despite the lack of experience, the Steel Hawks managed to create "Terra Hawk" in 2008 and "Crystal Hawk" in 2009.</p>
				<p class="history">Over the next few years, the team grew in size and knowledge. As the founding members became experts in their field, they taught new members, as the robotics program gained momentum in the school. Increasing in size each year, the team expanded in many ways. Organization improved with concrete meeting times, daily, and new ways to communicate through various means on the internet.</p>
				<p class="history">Recently, the team has gained much more recognition in the Townsend Harris community and towards young aspiring scientists in our school. Through participated in our school's Club Fair and Winter Carnival and selling lightbulbs during other smaller school events, we have gained much attention from students, parents, and teachers. The Steel Hawks as well as the FIRST Robotics programs are widely known in the school, increasing the number of interested students joining the team each year, spreading the message of FIRST.</p>

				<h3>Our School</h3>
				<p class="aboutschool">Townsend Harris is a young school with an honored past. In 1848 the New York Free Academy, our first municipal institution of free higher education, was established by the Board of Education due largely to the effort of Townsend Harris who was, at the time, the president of the Board. The Free Academy later became the City College of New York. The "introductory year" of the Free Academy grew into Townsend Harris High School which flourished until 1942 when it was closed by Mayor LaGuardia because of budgetary constraints.</p>
				<p class="aboutschool">In 1984, Townsend Harris was reopened with a new location of Flushing, NY and student body but the same spirit and desires as before. Beginning with the first new class, a tradition of expressing this spirit is found in the pledge the Townsend Harris student makes during his or her first year, known as the Ephebic Oath. The present school has had, from its inception, this rich tradition supported by an active group of alumni. The alumni arrange internships for students, serve as advisors and mentors and raise funds for special projects.</p>
				<p class="aboutschool">In order to prepare the students for ethical and intellectual challenges, Townsend Harris provides a rigorous curriculum with an emphasis on the humanities and classics, bolstered by mathematics, science, and the integration of current technology. The instructional program promotes respect for people and ideas, critical and creative thinking, and precision of language. The community encourages the students to strive for excellence, to make sensible decisions, and to develop an enduring commitment to serving the community.</p>
